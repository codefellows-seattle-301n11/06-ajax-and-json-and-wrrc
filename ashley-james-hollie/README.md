# AJAX and JSON and WRRC

**Author**: Ashley Breunich, James Denton, and Hollie Thomas
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
The purpose of this application is to load our blog articles from an external source (a JSON file) so that we do not need to keep all of the code on a local machine.   

## Getting Started
In order to use this program and get it running on your own computer, you will need to go to the [GitHub link](https://github.com/ashley-breunich/06-ajax-and-json-and-wrrc), fork the repository, and then clone it down to your machine.

## Architecture
This program utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Handlebars.js. The CSS is categorized using the SMACSS method. It also includes an icon style package from [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).
